# Visualizing Energy Types across the World

We wanted to provide new and inventive way to visualise a dataset related to energy and wealth distributions across the world. The full project can be accessed via the following link: https://visualreality.medium.com/

Visualization tools used:
- Tableau
- Vega & Vega-Lite
- D3

Below is the brief summary of the project:

### Dataset
We decided to work on the data about energy and its relationship with wealth. We mainly aimed to observe the trends in energy production and consumption across the World. We wanted to see the levels of prevalence for different energy sources in production and in consumption during the last half century. Additionally, we also wanted investigate their dependency on other variables such as GDP, population size and GDP per capita. The data are obtained via the following link: https://github.com/owid/energy-data

The data set consists of 117 variables. The list of explanations for each variable can be accessed via this link: https://tinyurl.com/8s8rke

### Insights
- We were able to visualize energy evolutions for individual countries and each energy source, in combination with continental and global evolutions. On a global scale, oil is the largest energy source, followed by coal. Although the share of low carbon energy is increasing rapidly, its rate of growth is not fast enough to offset the growth of fossil fuels consumption. We also saw that continents are characterized with different energy transitions. For instance, Europe reduced its coal share at the benefits of gas and nuclear.
- With our visualizations, we were able to see that wealth only had a mild effect on improving the clean energy share of countries and continents. However, because of representability issue, this could only be concluded for Americas and Europe. We compared the measures GDP and HDI and saw that these gave parallel insights.
